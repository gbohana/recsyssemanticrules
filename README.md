# A Recommendation System that uses semantic rules
This is a proposal of a RS using ontology and SWRL rules to infer from a Movielens 100K database, generating movie recommendations for offline users. This is part of an undergraduate thesis for the Computer Science course at Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA).

This repository contains the ontology generated by this work and used to evaluate the semantic rules as well as the file containing all the source code. The code lines refering to creating and populating the ontology have been commented out.
